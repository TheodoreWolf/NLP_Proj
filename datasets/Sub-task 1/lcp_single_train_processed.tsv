Through this process, it is also possible that deficits in RanBP2 cause a disturbance in the equilibrium between Cox11, HK1, and RanBP2 by leading to an increase of the inhibitory activity of Cox11 over HKI that promotes the uncoupling of the interaction of HKI from RanBP2, ultimately causing HKI degradation.	0.109375

Consequently, our data, and data from other studies, suggest that the complete lack of D2Rs in the olfactory bulb does not prevent transduction of olfactory stimuli; rather it affects the ability to habituate, or tune, olfactory nerve activity associated with repeatedly encountered concentrations of chemical stimuli [32].	0.175
The different times of embryonic lethality suggested that the first reported Capn4-/- mice [31] were targeted with a hypomorphic mutation, which retained some small level of calpain activity, allowing for their survival to mid-gestation, while the second reported Capn4-/- mice [32] represented a true null mutation.	0.175

In support of this, the expression of the human C-reactive protein, an acute-phase protein closely related to Apcs, has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB/W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex (Szalai et al. 2003).	0.3125

In addition, the combination of the C-terminal domains, RBD4 and CY (of RanBP2), associates with a subset of G protein-coupled receptors, the red/green opsin, expressed in photosensory neurons and enhances opsin functional production [6,7], while the interaction of the KBD of RanBP2 with a subset of the conventional microtubule-based motor proteins, the kinesins, KIF5B and KIF5C, occurs selectively in the central nervous system (CNS) [13].	0.260869565217391

In a third model, there would be a limiting quantity of transcription factors - the cell might contain a single transcriptional 'machine' that is capable of accommodating the promoter of only one olfactory receptor gene, similar to the expression site body used by African trypanosomes to ensure singular expression of only one set of variant surface glycoprotein genes [22].	0.175

Past experiments seeking to explore the possible involvement of dopamine D2Rs in associative learning have utilized low to moderate doses of drugs [2,5,6] and site-specific administration [7,9] in order to avoid the confounding effect that locomotor disruption associated with acute D2R blockade can have on learning performance in rodents.	0.183333333333333
That D2R-mediated signaling orchestrates just motor components of learning is a conclusion that is potentially biased due to the practice of avoiding doses of drugs that induce catalepsy (and therefore measuring only partial blockade of dopamine D2Rs) and single administrations [e.g. [3]].	0.263888888888889

In various manipulations of the neurotrophins it has been noted that molecular markers for proprioceptive axons such as PV or calcitonin gene-related peptide for nerve growth factor–responsive axons are compromised (Ringstedt et al. 1997; Patel et al. 2000), thus PV immunostaining in Bax/NT-3 double KOs cannot reveal the extent of proprioceptive axons in the periphery.	0.45

Because synapsis occurs in TRIP13-deficient spermatocytes and is dependent on DSB formation (activity of SPO11 and MEI1), we suggest that TRIP13 functions after homology recognition and strand exchange, and that recombination events entering the CO repair pathway are either completed or nearly so (because OA treated resulted in bivalent chromosomes).	0.402777777777778

Consistent with the idea that cells in this primordium are poised between two developmental pathways, some of the genes that are involved in establishing sexual dimorphism, including      Dax1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-congenital adrenal hypoplasia critical region on the X chromosome protein 1), Sox9 (Sry-like HMG box 9), Fgf9 (fibroblast growth factor 9), and      Wnt4 (wingless-related MMTV integration site 4), are initially expressed in similar patterns in XX and XY gonads [     3‚Äì     8].	0.5

Because synapsis occurs in TRIP13-deficient spermatocytes and is dependent on DSB formation (activity of SPO11 and MEI1), we suggest that TRIP13 functions after homology recognition and strand exchange, and that recombination events entering the CO repair pathway are either completed or nearly so (because OA treated resulted in bivalent chromosomes).	0.526315789473684

While it is possible that dox acts in some other way to slow amyloid clearance, data from multiple studies demonstrate that microglial responses are normally weak in the mouse AD models [37–40], and thus it is doubtful that dox-mediated microglial inhibition affected the outcome of our study.	0.558823529411765
However, the development of safe and effective secretase inhibitors will ultimately be required to determine whether the human brain has the capacity to repair amyloid-associated damage of AD once the progression of pathology is arrested.	0.583333333333333
It is possible that a combination of therapies to limit Aβ production, increase Aβ degradation, and enhance phagocytosis of deposited amyloid may be required to reverse damage associated with AD.	0.590909090909091
Early support for this hypothesis came from genetic studies linking early-onset AD to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), from which Aβ is derived, and presenilins 1 and 2, which are interchangeable components of a endoprotease complex that releases Aβ from APP (for review see [2,3]).	0.602941176470588

A system whereby, in connection with a decision that will have consequences for the next few years or decades, we have had one and a half hours in which to table amendments to the original versions, and not even that amount of time in committee, is a sort of binding mandate not to be debated, which Parliament has received on this highly important issue.	0.15625

Mr President, on the voting list of my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we proposed to vote in favour of Amendment 5 if the authors of the amendment accepted that it was an addition.	0.2

Seriously, though, committees meetings here in Strasbourg cannot continue to clash with plenary sittings and group meetings to the extent that this has been happening, especially over the last two years and in spite of all the declarations that such clashes were to be avoided.	0.3

Firstly, can the Commission provide an assessment of the 'state of play' in the main negotiating areas of the Doha Round, especially in agriculture, NAMA (non-agricultural market access) and services?	0.196428571428571
What is your projected date for the Treaty to come into force and, furthermore, with this provisional date in mind, has the Commission taken any steps as yet towards the transition of the treaties - from the Treaty of Nice to the Treaty of Lisbon - or are we still in a state of expectation, so to speak; are we waiting to see what will happen?	0.266666666666667
Following the personal interviews of the three new candidates, I would like to emphasise the good showing made by Mr Cretin, the French candidate, who will bring to the Court his considerable experience in international auditing, both in connection with the UN and NATO.	0.211538461538462

Our view is indeed shared by most businesses and Member States in stating that they do not apply this Directive.	0.176470588235294
The next item is the report by Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries - C7-0048/2010 -.	0.176470588235294
The complexity and significance of migration issues mean that everyone needs to tackle these, both countries of origin and countries of transit and destination.	0.233333333333333
I am thinking of Council Directive 2000/43/EC, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin in a number of contexts, and Council Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in the field of employment and occupation.	0.25
Of course, the two issues could be regarded as completely separate, but I believe it is the job of political institutions to be pragmatic and hence to understand that, faced with this enormous volume of production used for heroin - whilst a product from the same agricultural origin is in very short supply - it ought to be possible, as it were, to combine the two points of departure.	0.263888888888889
Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 9 - Code of conduct.	0.176470588235294
The Slovenian Presidency is usually very helpful, but unfortunately today's situation is such that you are right to complain.	0.176470588235294
It is an exacting task to discharge the responsibilities of the Presidency in the European Union, but at the same time it is a great honour and privilege, and Finland welcomes the challenge.	0.191176470588235
The European Parliament expects that it will be as amenable to our Parliament as the Hungarian Presidency.	0.236111111111111
Thus we begin the next Presidency of the European Union.	0.263157894736842
I shall do so gladly, and may I say at once - although it has just been remarked that we are too ready to sing our own praises - that, from the point of view of the Presidency - from my point of view - this was indeed a successful Council meeting.	0.264705882352941
(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible)	0.176470588235294
I urge you, Mr President, to ensure in future that where a Member has to present a report they are able to do so in their own language even if this means taking interpreting staff from another committee for the period concerned.	0.291666666666667
I will go through the committee's amendments point by point.	0.31578947368421
- (DE) Mr President, I just wanted to say something about the translation of Amendment 10, which has to do with Article 1, point 5 of Article 6b, paragraph 4, and where it appears that an error crept into the final report for voting in plenary through the transmission of the committee's vote.	0.323529411764706
(PT) Madam President, it does not make sense to refer this report, or this proposal, back to committee, because it was discussed with all the groups.	0.390625
It is important to take action that will help those firms to fully reap the benefits of the single market.	0.176470588235294

Finally, given that the College has been experiencing major difficulties since 2006 and that progress will not be seen until 2014, it is no longer acceptable for the College to need at least nine years to reach an adequate level of good administration.	0.234375
In the face of a standstill in the contract negotiations with the consortium candidate and in the absence of progress on the conditions that I laid down a year ago, I have issued an ultimatum with precise deadlines in order to break this deadlock.	0.347222222222222
We have brought together these facts in numerous thematic strategies, during which we invited two Nobel Prize laureates to Brussels and Strasbourg.	0.176470588235294
We should fear the day when the European Parliament stops debating these resolutions and stops standing firmly for the values that we believe in.	0.176470588235294
Under this heading one can identify a single Treaty instead of the several overlapping Treaties – a single, clearer document that spells out more clearly the objectives and the values of the Union and its competences, what it is responsible for and what it is not responsible for, and how it works, with fewer and clearer procedures.	0.2

It has therefore been my objective to define common rules at European level which will enable us to supervise the opt-out process.	0.263888888888889

We adopted the report in committee with a broad majority - 43 in favour, 1 against, 1 abstention - and some of the professional observers from other Member States were surprised that, following the controversial debate, a regulation was produced that received such a high level of support.	0.178571428571429

Many political activists are in prison, and the opposition party has decided to boycott the elections completely.	0.180555555555556

Mr President, I would like to begin by reminding us all that a few weeks ago Greenpeace reported a Galician company, Armadores Vidal, to the Spanish public prosecutor's office for receiving subsidies to the value of EUR 3.6 million from the Spanish Government, between 2003 and 2005, despite the fact that, since 1999, the company has accrued numerous sanctions in several countries for illegal fishing around the world.	0.18421052631579
(DE) Mr President, the aim of the proposal is to establish a new protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector between the European Community and the Union of the Comoros.	0.235294117647059
Whilst it is acceptable to combat racism - and by racism I mean the specific incitement to or the use of violence - it is not acceptable to confuse this concept with legitimate public debate, such as opposition to mass immigration, opposition to Islamisation or the defence of national identity.	0.183333333333333
It is very important that we always express solidarity with the soldiers who, on our behalf, are fighting terrorism as well as various other forms of abuse in Afghanistan and other countries.	0.183333333333333
In particular, it is a happy historical coincidence that we should be talking about railways when I come from a town called Alcázar de San Juan, which was a central point in the history of the railways and in the history of the workers' movement in my country.	0.1875
The report concerns a long-awaited proposal for a directive which is crucial for facilitating the free movement of persons and which takes into account the work carried out at the end of the 1990s, in particular by the high level panel chaired by Mrs Simone Veil, on citizenship of the European Union.	0.235294117647059
Mr President, could you please discuss this with the rapporteur, Mr Martin, in order to come to a solution as soon as possible?	0.183333333333333

- (ES) This oral amendment is intended to replace 'FTA' in paragraph 1(v) with the expression: 'Euro-Latin American Area of Global Interregional Partnership'.	0.25
I think that we have found a paragraph of exceptions in the compromise which is currently before us which gives the European Commission - Mr Potočnik, here I am addressing you directly - the tools to ensure over the next few years, better and more firmly than has been the case up to now, that the approximately 52 000 industrial plants in Europe which are affected by this finally make better use of best available techniques than they currently do.	0.277777777777778
However, I think we should give the Socialists a chance to reach a conclusion so that they too can do something to help reduce bureaucracy and the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.	0.183333333333333
Mr President, at the initiative of the Group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and with the approval and consent of the other groups, I propose that the following oral amendment be inserted after paragraph 6:	0.216666666666667
I understand there will be a similar request from the Socialists and they will also be requesting the deletion of paragraph 5, which we also support for similar reasons.	0.342105263157895
Mr President, my group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, would like to discuss Afghanistan and Cuba in September, provided that both points are well prepared in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.	0.352941176470588
Under such circumstances, I cannot allow my name or that of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to be associated with this document.	0.411764705882353
The next item is the debate on the European Council report and Commission statement - Results of the European Council (Brussels, 13-14 March 2008).	0.18421052631579

They must be accompanied by other public policies aimed at improving people's living conditions by guaranteeing access to healthcare, food, housing, schooling, educational success and stable employment, and by protecting the rights to a fair wage, to freedom of creation and cultural enjoyment, and to sports.	0.183333333333333

It did not approve the addition proposed by the Council concerning authorities' access to the system.	0.25

Situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes	0.3125
I would urge the President and the Conference of Presidents to look into this - to take their time and do it properly, but this, surely, is an instance where the imposition of penalties as foreseen under Rule 147 should be, at least, considered.	0.18421052631579
In accordance with Rule 123, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in the Texts Adopted of this sitting, together with the names of the signatories.	0.223684210526316
Despite the willingness of Member States to cooperate in the field of taxation, tangible results have not been achieved, and tax fraud remains at an extremely high level in the EU and brings far too many negative implications both to our economies and our citizens.	0.18421052631579
In the areas most seriously affected, such as the Peloponnese and central and eastern Greece, regional economies were badly hit.	0.296875
The international crisis has, and will have, an impact on our economies, but the extent of the impact will vary according to country.	0.3
Together with the eighth session, to take place in the first two weeks of June, it is to debate the extension of 25 special rapporteurs' mandates, regular reports by special rapporteurs and several disturbing human rights situations in some countries with regard to certain topics.	0.18421052631579
That is because the task of the European Council is not only to respond to direct crisis situations, but also to formulate strategic guidelines for the future.	0.216666666666667

The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the rule of law in Russia.	0.215909090909091
It has become an important forum, but its role should be strengthened in terms of coordination between Member States and the monitoring of the implementation of the Consensus, and in terms of advocating humanitarian aid in relation to the other working parties of the Political and Security Committee.	0.1875
Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers, including through direct reinjection of surface waters.	0.1875

We are, however, very far from happy with the fact that the Council's willingness to agree to be present only to a very limited extent means that a great deal of today's agenda has had to be put off to another day.	0.214285714285714
The first was for the Council statement on the situation in Guinea to be placed on the agenda as the second item.	0.275

Of course, the European Union needs to help about half the population of the planet who are living below the poverty line.	0.352941176470588

Under the proposed decision, Ukraine could get a loan of up to EUR 500 million in order to finance its balance of payments deficit and meet external financing needs.	0.2
I believe that after all our work, we are today handing shared thoughts and proposals to the Commission, on a topic close to Mrs Ashton's heart, as we heard from her opening speech as Commissioner, and one that must be tackled without delay if we want to resolve, at least in part, the serious economic and financial crisis that is haunting our workers and citizens.	0.226190476190476
On the supply side, droughts and floods have played their part in wrecking harvests, input costs have risen and this has all been compounded by financial speculation in the commodity markets.	0.203125
My main objective as rapporteur for the budgets of Parliament and the other institutions was to keep any increase as low as possible.	0.203125
In order to meet the objective of reducing these infections by 900 000 cases a year by 2015 - in other words a 20% reduction - the Member States and the European institutions are being called on to introduce the necessary measures.	0.236111111111111
The objective that we are pursuing is the development of a European integrated management system for all the EU's external borders, based on operational coordination and interoperability among national surveillance systems, because, when one route for illegal immigration is closed, criminal organisations set up another route in less than a week.	0.288461538461538

I would like to thank the Commission for working with me in drafting this report and also the very many committees in the House, in particular the Committee on Development, which were obviously involved in its production.	0.328947368421053

This Summit did not satisfy all of our expectations in this regard.	0.205882352941176
More effective and better supervision and cooperation among supervisors is a matter of necessity, but, nevertheless, if we want the ultimate result to be success, we do think that, at this stage of the development and profound transformation of financial markets, the opening of an interinstitutional debate on this subject is, without doubt, the best way of making headway.	0.205882352941176
Nevertheless, when I have spoken over the years with a number of supervisors and other high-level representatives from the industry and supervision, people told me: 'We cannot say this publicly, but you are right that something more has to happen; a real crisis situation will show that this is not sufficient'.	0.236111111111111

However, while the many advantages are both immediate and conspicuous, I welcome more than anything else the fact that the FTA has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism - a safeguard that allows the EU to restore MFN duty rates, should it be that this particular FTA has led to or threatens to cause serious injury to EU domestic industry.	0.275
However, observations need to be made in relation to certain misconceptions, which fail to take into account how radically the CAP has been revised.	0.265625
However, I too want to thank everyone who took part in this report and underline one very important point: what Parliament is offering today in relation to the legislative review of the electronic communications sector, as already stated by Catherine Trautmann, is wholly consistent and, we believe, will be very positive in terms of developing this market.	0.267857142857143

In making a reminder of the right of Moldovan citizens to vote, 'calls on' should be replaced by 'states that' and after 'Transnistria', 'have no right to prevent ...' should be inserted.	0.208333333333333
Mr President, my group attaches particular importance to the requirement that this European External Action Service should have full political and budgetary responsibility.	0.208333333333333

Mr President, Mrs Lulling and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) know that there was intense debate on this report, which included contributions from MEPs of all parties, or almost all; they know that a clear majority in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality voted in favour of it and that there were only two votes against it, one of which was by Mrs Lulling and the other by another Member.	0.25
The last provocation by the ruling regime against its citizens was last month's 500 percent increase in fuel prices.	0.214285714285714

- (DE) Mr President, very briefly, this concerns the amendment of the Rules of Procedure in light of the new Statute from 2009.	0.214285714285714
I would urge you most strongly not to listen to this kind of lunatic lobbying: read the amendment carefully, and you will see that it says just the opposite.	0.234375
Therefore, to be factually correct and to include all freedoms of expression, not just on the internet, we ask that the phrase 'on the internet' be removed from the amendment.	0.266666666666667
For this reason, we would like to build a bridge to the amendment by proposing that it be reworded.	0.283333333333333

It needs to be refined because we have seen, in the brief time that discussion has been allowed on this, that there are different interests, all of which are absolutely legitimate, among the airlines, that there are companies waiting to replace others, where the first are unable to meet their commitments, that there are now distinct interests among airlines and airports, something that did not happen only a short time ago, and above all that there are the interests of passengers, most importantly those served by airports and airlines in the outermost regions, who would be at greater risk should the choice of retaining or abolishing slots depend solely on their profitability for the companies concerned.	0.216666666666667
If it transpires that the private operators back out owing to profitability problems, the EU should take the consequences and discontinue the project or allow interested Member States to join in, as happened with Boeing.	0.333333333333333

I should like to make a proposal regarding the amendments dealing with the legal base: the Presidency must decide on the admissibility of these amendments, specifically, Amendments 159, 119, 116 and 125, but the decision naturally has to depend on the final configuration of the directive, which will be modified in the course of voting.	0.216666666666667

What I am not willing to accept, however, is the way in which this was prepared and staged, and I would also like to tell the Secretary-General, Mr Rømer, that I intend to energetically follow up what he said in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, so I will tell the plenary that I, the chairman of my group, had no advance notice of this event whatever.	0.238095238095238

We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it.	0.25

Biodiversity should form part of not only European nature policy but also other policies, such as fisheries, agriculture and regional policy.	0.25
The proactive attitude of this Parliament, along with a general awareness of the state of fisheries resources and marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean, has contributed to the achievement of a sound compromise.	0.305555555555556
For some time now, the fisheries sector has been very concerned at the absence of security in that part of the Indian Ocean where piracy has become rife and where a French yacht was seized recently on 11 April.	0.359375
Without these three aspects, we will not have any fisheries in the European Union, or, at least, there will be none that are sustainable and capable of developing, which is what we all want.	0.430555555555556
For my part, I would like to remind you that our committee attaches great importance to this matter, which brings into play the main aspects of the common fisheries policy: resource management, fleet management, respect for international, regional and bilateral agreements, technical measures and, above all, monitoring, to which I will return shortly.	0.470588235294118

Another point that I cannot ignore, either, is that this report is being debated within a 'new era' in terms of monetary policy - with interest rates that have been rising for some time and threaten to keep on rising - and at a stage when we are embarking on the new Stability and Growth Pact as revised by the Commission, and when the Member States are for the first time coming before the European institutions to account for what they have done regarding the Lisbon Strategy in their national reform plans.	0.319444444444444

Mr President, the report on which we have just voted is a serious blow to the citizens of the European Union, whom the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to foot the bill for this neoliberal crisis.	0.25
The amendments put forward in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by Mrs Gomes on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as well as those tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in plenary, have helped to ensure that the proposal on the table today is not an alternative one, that is, a negative proposal calling for the policy pursued hitherto to be replaced overnight.	0.25
Mr President, avian influenza has affected poultry populations in nine countries in Asia so far, namely Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, including the special administrative region of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.	0.25
Then I pick up a report like this and I discover that EUR 1.6 billion of European taxpayers' money has been spent on this edifice that is the European Parliament, then I discover that EUR 9.3 million has been lavished upon the political parties in the European Parliament, and then I look and see a reaffirmation of a commitment to a 30% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020, but not a single mention of the most outrageous emission of all - that which flows from the unnecessary travel to this place, 12 times a year.	0.25

Too often, what we see is a realisation of the urgency of the situation and a juxtaposition of national solutions that are then dressed up as a European solution.	0.4
I therefore believe that we need to have the courage to tear down the walls between private enterprise and business and the state, and allow entrepreneurs to provide aid in a way that is different from the way we have provided it in the past.	0.294117647058823
That proposal for compromise is founded on some of the resistance from the Council of Ministers, and it disappoints me that the Council Presidency is not represented here tonight.	0.294117647058823

I believe that we all recognise the urgent need for an effort to meet commitments to halt the loss of biodiversity in the European Union by 2010.	0.296875
Mr President, as an oral amendment I would like to propose that the protection of biodiversity in our amendment would be an addition to the original text of the paragraph.	0.338235294117647
Thus, it is LIFE+ that will govern Europe's innovative policies, that will rise to the challenges, such as the fight against climate change and the efforts to rid the air and soil of pollution, that will prevent biodiversity damage and that will provide the Environment DG and the NGOs, our bio-indicators par excellence, with the means to endow the Member States' environmental policies with European added value.	0.407894736842105
I recognise, however, that the action plan will be insufficient to conserve biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services in the longer term.	0.421875
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Samecki, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and the EU is about to press ahead with a new strategy for biodiversity, in other words, for the protection of flora and fauna within the area of the European Union.	0.428571428571429

I regret that our Parliament has been unable to devote sufficient time to the drafting of a precise report on the text of this proposal for an instrument that is crucial to the future of our outermost regions.	0.297619047619048
Similarly, the fishing effort should be matched to existing resources and to the protection of the marine environment - which would at one and the same time promote small-scale coastal fishing and non-industrial fishing and safeguard fishing communities; it would be particularly helpful in that context to increase Member States' exclusive fishing zones from the current 12 nautical miles to 24 nautical miles and for outermost regions from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles.	0.307692307692308
One of the most important aspects of the structure of the Union is the real accountability of Commissioners before this Parliament, which must relate to questions of relative detail that can be raised at Question Time, not just to issues of general policy.	0.297619047619048
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last debate on the state of the Union to be held before the end of the current parliamentary term, that is to say, before the elections due in June 1999.	0.40625
The first suggestion is slightly philosophical, but it is fundamental: let us rebuild our policies towards our neighbours according to our values, values that we share and, in particular, democracy.	0.3
Can I ask you to correct an inaccuracy there: it says that Question No 51 by my colleague, Mr Bowe, fell as he was absent.	0.3
On page 28 of the Rainbow he suggests that we do not have any democratic mandate or legitimacy because we were elected on a Labour ticket and therefore we should not be sitting as Members of the House.	0.3
I would also like to express support for the first interim report on climate change presented last Monday to your Climate Change Committee.	0.3

It is therefore very difficult to understand or accept that around 30 activists, politicians and bloggers were arrested by government forces while travelling to the southern Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi to express their condolences to the families of those killed during the sectarian violence.	0.3

I should therefore like to congratulate the Commission on proposing to us the introduction of biometric identifiers containing an image and fingerprints in interoperable formats.	0.302631578947368
It is still not clear whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection.	0.34375

The Commission, Member States, trade unions, as well as governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, must do all in their power to improve awareness of rights under these directives and Member States must adequately resource independent bodies to promote equality and encourage Member States to ensure the remit of those bodies covers all forms of discrimination.	0.392857142857143
Madam President, I would like to underline what Mrs Bowles has said: we are hoping to find a final agreement on the report before our plenary session in July.	0.392857142857143

The recent price volatility that we saw, starting in 2007, has shown that it is, or it will be, necessary to include milk under this article, because this would then allow the Commission to take faster action.	0.392857142857143
We tried to strengthen the present text by asking that these rules in the European Union be 'urgently revised to avoid arbitrage between guarantee levels in Member States that may further increase volatility and undermine financial stability instead of increasing security and depositors' confidence'.	0.416666666666667

Faced with this situation and the imminence of negotiations which might begin next Monday in Brussels, I do not think the Commission will give us much information today, due to the fact that it will do this - we hope - on Monday 30 October.	0.394736842105263

This decision, which, provisionally, has put an end to five years of negotiations and more than seven years of diplomatic efforts, has led to great uncertainty within the multilateral framework of the WTO trade negotiations and, furthermore, it raises a problem with regard to an informal time limit, which is more political than chronological: the forthcoming expiry of the mandate of the Trade Promotion Authority, granted to the President by the United States Congress to allow him to negotiate in global terms.	0.517857142857143

After the resolution on the Budgetary Framework and Priorities for 2009 in April comes our resolution 'First reflections on the 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget and mandate for the conciliation'.	0.4
I believe that, without them, the conciliation could not have been brought to a successful conclusion because, I must point out, if we have obtained entirely positive results, it is because we defended a strong position within the European Parliament and because, together, we stood up, I would say, to the Commission and to the Council on several points.	0.402777777777778
Mr President, the Council notes with satisfaction that Parliament has confirmed the agreement that we reached at the conciliation meeting on 18 November this year.	0.466666666666667
The document we are debating and shall be voting on today is about providing the European Parliament's delegation with a special mandate ahead of this conciliation with the Danish Presidency and the Commission.	0.470588235294118
After the technical check of the figures, a small number of technical adjustments were necessary to ensure full respect of the conciliation outcome of 23 November as regards revised financial framework ceilings and the overall level of payments.	0.546875
The fact is that, numerically speaking, that is the only way in which a majority in this House will come into being, and that is why we are presented with the unaccustomed sight of parties that, in their domestic, indigenous, national reality are as a rule the complete natural antithesis of each other – Socialists on the one hand, Christian Democrats and Conservatives on the other – attempting in this House to work together from time to time, which, in many cases, evokes misgivings back home.	0.4
Albania and Bosnia have to catch up with Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.	0.4
Implementation of that code resulted in closer cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistics institutes and in improved reliability of statistical data gathered for many purposes; in particular, however, I would like to refer to one objective which has been the subject of debate here over the years, namely the excessive public deficit procedure.	0.4
In particular, we cannot allow the massacre and eviction of the Italians to be described merely as a measure intended to combat collaboration with nazis and fascists, in the spirit of Potsdam and Yalta which divided Europe and from which Europe has had to regain its freedom and unity and is still in the process of doing so.	0.4

(PL) Madam President, I would like today to comment on the serious accusation which was made in this Chamber against Members of the European Parliament, and on the slander of the European Parliament uttered by Mr Martin when he said that some MEPs do not vote themselves, but send proxies, who vote using the MEPs' voting cards.	0.404761904761905
There has also been a move in policing towards a predictive and preventive approach which, while not without value in some circumstances, can lead to repressive measures against innocent people based on stereotyping, often on the basis of race or even religion.	0.40625

We are still left with the subjects of the efficiency, fluidity and safety of transport, and to these we are adding concerns relating to the people living near, and the environment surrounding, the routes.	0.407894736842105
Firstly, I would like to point out that the report has two different scopes: the first is to describe and assess the situation, which is unfortunately a negative one, of human rights in many countries and regions of the world, often bordering on or entering into the territory of human tragedy; the second is an assessment based on the past experience of this Parliament in the adoption of positions in response to various problems, and also based on a wish on the rapporteur's part for the report to be situated within the mainstream of the positions and acts of the various European Union institutions, not seeking to emphasise elements of disagreement, but rather, at heart, aspects of agreement.	0.410714285714286
The Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu - exotic places, fantastic places, so distant, so far away, so romantic and so on, but actually they are in need.	0.410714285714286
We therefore now hold our services on the street, where we also baptise our children and celebrate the sacraments.	0.410714285714286
As well as these educational elements, equipment and access to new technologies also play an absolutely critical role and in this respect there are great discrepancies, for example between the different Member States of the European Union and between rural and urban areas.	0.410714285714286
The greatest virtue of this directive is the adoption of the waste hierarchy.	0.411764705882353
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fava report is worth little more than a collage of press cuttings; while it pretends to uphold human rights, it is in fact an attempt to demolish the power and effectiveness of anti-terrorism activities.	0.411764705882353
The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B7-0232/2009) by Mr Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on prospects for the Doha Development Agenda following the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference.	0.411764705882353

This declaration is in favour of maintaining European identity and the identities of our countries in order to ensure that our modernity is rooted in European traditions.	0.411764705882353
Here are all the trite, clichéd phrases that we associate with EU directives: 'e-commerce is a vital force of the Internet'; 'an important catalyst for achieving the aims of the EU 2020 strategy'; 'it is important for all stakeholders to cooperate'.	0.411764705882353
I propose to correct them as follows: in recital B, to replace the word 'authors' with the word 'perpetrators', and in recital C, to replace the words 'intellectual authors' with the word 'instigators'.	0.416666666666667
When one of our colleagues, Mr Ruiz Mateos, was prevented from taking an oath in Spain because legal action was being taken against him, you cited national sovereignty as a defence.	0.416666666666667
I am sure, Mrs Lulling, that this detail had not escaped the Members of this House, but I gave the floor to our rapporteur because she did not have the opportunity to speak during the debates.	0.416666666666667
Again, let me – in this case in her absence – congratulate Mrs Ries on this appointment and note, pursuant to Rule 8(4), that her mandate as a Member of the European Parliament has terminated and that a vacancy exists as of 12 February 2004.	0.416666666666667
Mr President, a letter was sent from Commissioner Patten to the President of Parliament yesterday asking Parliament to adopt, as quickly as possible, Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 in order to allow the budgetisation of the EUR 70 million for Afghanistan.	0.416666666666667
A number of political groups and parties within this Parliament will decide how they vote on the eleventh plenary and its siting.	0.416666666666667

While aspects of the climate package were on the agenda at last week's summit meeting, and a requirement from that summit that any future revisions on amendments to aspects of EU ETS be available to be considered by future summits, at the subsequent trialogue on Saturday morning in Brussels, I added, with the full support of all the shadow rapporteurs, a new recital to my report - subsequent to the summit - which was then accepted by COREPER on Saturday afternoon.	0.421052631578947
(NL) Mr President, I was happy to add my emphatic support to the Coelho report on biometrics in EU passports, because, if nothing else, this is a first step in the fight against the very many abuses and forgeries of passports.	0.421875
Madam President, as can be seen from the resolution itself, after two months of violent clashes, Andry Rajoelina, former mayor of the capital of Madagascar, staged a coup d'état on 17 March of this year; he was supported by the army and a self-proclaimed 'High Authority of Transition', over which he presides, and he suspended the national assembly and the senate.	0.421875
This document shows that Member States are managing increasingly well with the transposition of EU law.	0.421875
However, my report also criticises the fact that the complex interaction of European legislation and national transposition has not resulted in a simplification and debureaucratisation of public procurement, as was, in fact, the aim of the 2004 revision, but rather in more work, high external costs for legal advice and protracted procedures.	0.45
Mr President, Mr Landsbergis, who knows the North Caucasus better than almost anyone else, has left a few brief oral amendments which tighten up the text and which I would ask you to support.	0.421875
Despite some very positive signals from President Medvedev last year, the actual human rights situation in Russia and, in particular, in the Northern Caucasus region, remains deeply preoccupying.	0.5
We encourage the Russian authorities to demonstrate full commitment to ensuring the rule of law and to bringing an end to the climate of lawlessness and impunity in the region of the North Caucasus.	0.517857142857143
'Nagorno-Karabakh and Georgia' would therefore be deleted and replaced by 'in Moldova and the South Caucasus'.	0.535714285714286

Twenty-five people have been killed or injured because they were albinos during the last six months.	0.425

The key proposal, and the one that has created a degree of controversy, is to have 25 Members of Parliament for a pan-European constituency, elected from transnational lists drawn up by the European political parties.	0.425

I will stress that again, especially for the Finns sitting across the table.	0.426470588235294
The next item is the report by Mrs Klaß on behalf of the Parliament and Council delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the protection of groundwater against pollution	0.426470588235294
On the one hand, we have an entirely justified and necessary interest on the part of most persons involved in the political process, which is to inform themselves and to find out more quickly and in detail about linkages which may exist, especially in the corporate sector, and how they work, especially across borders: borders which, happily, we have already dismantled successfully between many countries throughout Europe.	0.426470588235294
A significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions - almost totally disconnected from the economy resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights - that fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy ratification but must be handled as bridging one of the most enormous gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe.	0.426470588235294
This is why we are extremely concerned by the delays in the ratification process.	0.430555555555556

In this case we are considering a price increase from a health perspective among others, but we cannot be so fanatical as to introduce a price increase that certain Member States simply cannot sustain, or that would increase smuggling, especially in Member States on the periphery.	0.5

Madam President, under Rule 128 I must move the admissibility of the document to be debated.	0.4375
I should like to make a proposal regarding the amendments dealing with the legal base: the Presidency must decide on the admissibility of these amendments, specifically, Amendments 159, 119, 116 and 125, but the decision naturally has to depend on the final configuration of the directive, which will be modified in the course of voting.	0.446428571428571
We have therefore tried to simplify things by giving a kind of admissibility incentive.	0.546875
