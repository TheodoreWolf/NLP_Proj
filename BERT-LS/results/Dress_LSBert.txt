There was nothing so very extraordinary in that ;
nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself ,
` Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be late ! '
( when she thought it over again , it came to her that she should to have looked at this , but at the time it all was quite natural ) ;
but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its pocket ,
and looked at it , and then went on , Alice started to her feet , for it passed across her mind that she had never before seen a man with either a coat ,
or a watch to take out of it , and burning with desire , she ran across the field after it ,
and it was just in time to see it drop down a large rock under the trees .
